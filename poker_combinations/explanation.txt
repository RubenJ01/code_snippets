I want to merge two notepads worth of text into one (With a twist).

I have two long lists of hand data in two separate notepads for poker combination simulations.

The text chunks describe the hands in a betting range.

The format: 9s7s6s3s@15

The first eight characters are just the hand itself, 9 of spades, 7 of spades, 6 of spades, 3 of spades.
The @15 means, "bet this exact hand 15% of the time."

1.
If there is a hand match between the two text documents,
(ex: 9s7s6s3s@15 in one of the notepads and 9s7s6s3s@68 in the other)

then add the last two digits of each together, to make 9s7s6s3s@83.
then copy this answer followed by a comma in a new notepad that can hold atleast .5-1mb of text.
(unless its the very last hand, then no comma, as its the end of the long list of hands.)

(If the sum is over 100, make sure it doesn't go over 100. This shouldn't be a problem anyway)
(MATCH= same suit and same cards)
(Example of two NOT MATCHING hands: (9s7s6s3s and 9s7s6s3h, or 9s7s6s3s and 9s7s6s4s)
(Example of two MATCHING hands: (9s7s6s3s and 9s7s6s3s, or 9s7s6s3s and 3s9s7s6s) (The latter shouldn't appear anyway)
2.

If there is no  hand match between the two notepads, (ex: 9s7s6s3s@15 found in one notepad, but the other doesn't have a 9s7s6s3s)
then just put that hand ZyZyZyZy@XX followed by a comma in the new notepad since it is unique.

I want this basically:

notepad 1 (long list of garbage): 9s7s6s3s@15,Ts7s6s3s@1,9s9h9c9d@46..............................

notepad 2(long list of garbage): 9s7s6s3s@68,Ts7s6s3s@11.............................

SEARCH/ADD stuff and then...

notepad 3 RESULT: 9s7s6s3s@83,Ts7s6s3s@12,9s9h9c9d@46...............
